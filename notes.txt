what is react?

-> react is js library for user building interfaces, primarily maintained by meta. and a community of devolopers.
it allows devs to build dynamic web apps efficiently.



why was REACT CREATED?

-> React was created in 2011 by jordan walke, a software engineer at facebook. the primary goal was to address issues 
with performance and complexity in facebook web apps.

problems meta faced: the increasing complexity of facebook's UI LED to performance issues with traditional js and 
jquery solutions.

solution: React introduced a novel approach called the virtual DOM which improved performance and allowed devs to
think of their UI's as a tree of reusable components.

React was open sourced in 2013 and has since become one of the most popular libraries for frontend devolopment.


CORE CONCEPT OF REACT:

1) Component based architecture: 
   - React apps are built using components : small, reusable pieces of UI.
   - Components can be functional or class-based

2) Declarative programming: 
   - instead of manually manipulating the DOM, devs define what UI should look like and React takes care of updating
     the DOM.

3) VIRTUAL DOM: 
   - React uses a lightweigth, in-memory representation of the DOM(virtual DOM).

4) JSX:
   - React uses a syntax extensiojn called JSX, which allows HTML-like code to coexist with JS logic.

5) Undirectional Data flow: 
   - React data flow is one-way, making it easier to understand and debug applications.

6) State and props: 
   - Represents the dynamic data of a compomnent.
   - Props: Allow components to communicate with each other by passing data.



WHY REACT IS SO POPULAR? 

 - performance
 - Flexibility
 - Rich ecosystem
 - Community and support
 - reusablity
 - used for making SPA's(single page apps), mobile apps(react native)
 - Backed by meta
 - Cross platform devolopment
 - SEO friendly


ADVANTAGES OF REACT: 

 - Learning curve: react is relatively easy to learn for devolopers familiar with javascript.
 - Rich Tooling: Devolopers tools like react devTools simplify debugging.
 - Scalability: Suitable for both small and large scale apps
 - Backward compatibility: Updates rarely break Backward compatibility, making upgrades smoother.

Task1: 
get me differences btw libraries and framework 

library: 
A JavaScript library is a collection of classes, methods, and pre-written functions that developers can use in their web development projects.
Libraries make code reusable and simplify the development process.

framework: 
JavaScript frameworks are essential tools for creating web applications. 
They provide built-in components that help in developing robust and interactive web applications.

task2: 
what are react versions ? and why should we choose react?

current: 19.0.0

One of the main benefits of using React JS is its potential to reuse components.
It saves time for developers as they don't have to write various codes for the same features. 
Furthermore, if any changes are made in any particular part, it will not affect other parts of the application.


task3: 
react vs nextjs

 

- A framework provides a structured foundation for building an application, while a library is a collection of reusable code components that developers can use into their applications to perform specific tasks essentially, a framework tells you "how" to build something, while a library provides tools to help you build it. 

- Control flow:
In a framework, the framework controls the application flow, calling your code when needed, whereas in a library, you explicitly call the library functions when you want to use them. 

- Scope:
Frameworks tend to be larger and more comprehensive, providing a structure for the entire application, while libraries are usually smaller and focused on specific functionalities. 

- Flexibility:
Libraries offer more flexibility as you can choose how and when to use their functions, while frameworks are more opinionated and require you to follow their predefined structure.

 Features like concurrent rendering, server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG) improve performance for large-scale apps.

React is an excellent choice for both small projects and large enterprise applications because of its flexibility, ease of use, and scalability.
